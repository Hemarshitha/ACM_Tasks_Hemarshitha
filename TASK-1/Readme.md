During the creation of my web application which aims at showcasing my portfolio, I started out with wireframing to logically structure the layout and ensure that all the important parts are in place. I gave preeminence to agile design and therefore made use of flexible grid systems and media queries to provide the best view in all devices. The HTML structure used semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section> and <footer> to improve on usability . A fixed navigation bar was applied to enable different sections of the portfolio to be accessible quickly, which was also supplemented with smooth scrolling to enhance user experience. I Used CSS, for the styling of the portfolio, mainly on typography, colors and spacing in addition to aligning using flexbox and grid systems. Custom styles which included hover over buttons and project images to make them more attractive were added. I as well employed JavaScript for some interactive elements such as smooth scroll navigation and back to top button which helped increased interactivity.
