Hey There!
This Task was regarding the deplyment of a simpe smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using solidity..As i wasn't familiar with blockchain technology and Solidity i took a lot of help from google regarding code-wise as well asconnecting metamask..
so initially i found out that ropsten test network is not present anymore so i started with Sepolia ETH...
so when i got the code i create a file called SimpleTokensol in Remix IDE and i had run the program and there were no errors..
Now i had added the metamask extension to chrome and created a wallet and connected to sepolia ethereum...
And,i collected appx 0.15 ETH from Sepolia Faucet and have been trying this since a week
so,i coonected to Injected Provider WEB-3 and tried with both custom and given gas requirement like fom 500000 to 3000000 with an initial supply of 10 and 100 and 1000  but during deployment it kept saying gass transition failed though many simple contracts just need 0.1 ETH to deploy them.Here's a screenshot i am attaching with the problem
